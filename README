My Configuration Files

This is a simple repository for my configuration files. You can use snippets, whole files, anything. Many of these configs include borrowed pieces that are not my work; assume that everything here is licenced under the GPL.

I currently have configurations for:
* zsh
* vim
* openbox
* tint2
* gtk
* tmux
* xchat
* irssi

The scripts in 'bin' are used by various config files.

See the screenshot for more info.
